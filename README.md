# RENT.IO 

- An online renting mobile-based application registering users (whether as a Seller or a shop) enabling them to list items to rent or borrow items from other users.

## Existing System

- In today’s market, renting out individual property and goods has become very common. But the problem arises when we talk about the integration of such a market place.

- There are many renting platforms but each function only for a specific kind of goods or service. There are renting sites available
but some only rent properties, some only rent furniture or some will only rent consumer electronics

## Proposed System
- OLX is a current existing system which only operates on the buying and selling of goods between users.
- Rent.IO brings in the renting aspect and allows users and shops to rent out goods.
- Our app seeks to bring together the entire renting marketplace under one roof. Where the user can rent out anything he wishes for, it can be anything from a camera for a day to a flat house for a month.
- All renting needs will be fulfilled in our sole app. With strict identification features and code of conduct, we will ensure fraud will be minimum and fair trade takes place between users
- This app can promote offline renting businesses like local car, furniture renting companies which are yet to go online and face sales difficulties.
